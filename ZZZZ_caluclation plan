### B. Acid-Base Titration (Back Titration)

**Use back titration when:**
1. The substance is **insoluble or slightly soluble** (e.g., Mg(OH)₂, CaCO₃, MgO)
2. The reaction is **slow**
3. The endpoint is **difficult to detect directly**
4. The substance is **volatile** (e.g., NH₃)

**Common back titration systems:**

| Substance | Reason for Back Titration | Procedure |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Mg(OH)₂ (milk of magnesia) | Slightly soluble, slow reaction | Add excess acid, titrate excess with alkali |
| CaCO₃ (limestone/antacid) | Insoluble, slow with weak acids | Add excess acid, titrate excess |
| MgO | Insoluble base | Add excess acid, titrate excess |
| Ammonium salts | Indirect determination | Add excess NaOH, heat to drive off NH₃, titrate excess |

**Indicator Selection for Back Titration:**
- If excess acid is titrated with strong base → phenolphthalein
- If excess base is titrated with strong acid → methyl orange

## PART 6: RAM TOGGLE IMPLEMENTATION

**When RAM Toggle = ON:**
- Include "(Relative atomic masses: [element] = [value], [element] = [value], ...)" after the problem statement
- Provide all relevant RAM values needed for the calculation
- Students do NOT need to refer to periodic table

**When RAM Toggle = OFF:**
- Omit all RAM information
- Students must use their own knowledge or periodic table to find RAM values
- The problem should still be solvable with standard RAM values

**Example with RAM ON:**
> "A student dissolved 2.50 g of hydrated sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃·xH₂O) in water and made the solution up to 250.0 cm³ in a volumetric flask. A 25.0 cm³ portion of this solution required 23.5 cm³ of 0.100 mol/dm³ hydrochloric acid for neutralization using methyl orange indicator. (Relative atomic masses: H = 1.0, C = 12.0, O = 16.0, Na = 23.0)"

**Example with RAM OFF:**
> "A student dissolved 2.50 g of hydrated sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃·xH₂O) in water and made the solution up to 250.0 cm³ in a volumetric flask. A 25.0 cm³ portion of this solution required 23.5 cm³ of 0.100 mol/dm³ hydrochloric acid for neutralization using methyl orange indicator."

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (RAM ON)

**Problem:**
> In a titration experiment, a student finds that 23.5 cm³ of hydrochloric acid of concentration 0.150 mol/dm³ is required to completely neutralize 25.0 cm³ of a solution containing sodium hydroxide using methyl orange as indicator. (Relative atomic masses: H = 1.0, O = 16.0, Na = 23.0, Cl = 35.5)

**Balanced Equation:**
> HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1:** Write the balanced equation and identify mole ratio
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)
Mole ratio HCl : NaOH = 1 : 1

**Step 2:** Calculate moles of HCl used
Volume of HCl = 23.5 cm³ = 0.0235 dm³
Concentration of HCl = 0.150 mol/dm³
Moles of HCl = concentration × volume = 0.150 × 0.0235 = 0.003525 mol

**Step 3:** Use mole ratio to find moles of NaOH
From equation, 1 mol HCl reacts with 1 mol NaOH
Moles of NaOH = moles of HCl = 0.003525 mol

**Step 4:** Calculate concentration of NaOH
Volume of NaOH = 25.0 cm³ = 0.0250 dm³
Concentration of NaOH = moles / volume = 0.003525 / 0.0250 = 0.141 mol/dm³

**Step 5:** Convert to g/dm³
Molar mass of NaOH = 23.0 + 16.0 + 1.0 = 40.0 g/mol
Concentration in g/dm³ = 0.141 × 40.0 = 5.64 g/dm³

**Final Answer:**
> Concentration of NaOH = 0.141 mol/dm³ = 5.64 g/dm³
