Identity / keys
id
Purpose: The unique item identifier. This becomes Firestore doc id: items/{id} and is what the UI sends to chemcityPurchaseCard.
Used by: store listing, ownedItems array, purchase, equip.
Concern if you change: High risk. Changing id will:
Break existing users’ ownedItems references
Cause “Item not found” if Firestore doesn’t have the new doc id
Create duplicates if both old + new exist
Rule: Treat id as permanent once published.
chemicalKey
Purpose: A “topic-ish” key / internal chemical identifier (often same as formula key). Mainly used for grouping/searching or logic you might add later.
Concern: Medium. Changing it won’t usually break purchases, but may break filters, matching, analytics, or any code relying on it.
baseId
Purpose: Uniqueness group for equipping. Backend equip logic enforces: if two equipped items share the same baseId, equipping one may auto-unequip the other.
Used by: chemcityEquipCard (very important).
Concern if you change: High gameplay impact.
If you set many items to same baseId, users can’t equip them together.
If you blank it out, users can equip duplicates freely.
Rule: Use baseId for “same chemical family” if you want exclusivity.
Display fields
name
Purpose: Display name in store / UI.
Concern: Low (safe).
chemicalFormula
Purpose: Display text (NH3, NaCl, etc).
Concern: Low (safe).
description, funFact
Purpose: Lore/education text shown in UI.
Concern: Low (safe). Just watch for very long text / formatting.
Placement / equipping rules (ChemCity gameplay)
placeId
Purpose: Which “place” this item belongs to (e.g. toilet, kitchen, lab).
Used by: equip validation and UI grouping.
Concern: High.
Must match a real place in places collection / data/places.json.
If you change it, the item may become unequippable or appear in wrong place.
validSlots
Purpose: Comma-separated list of slotIds where this item is allowed to be equipped.
Used by: frontend CardPicker filtering and backend equip validation.
Concern: Very high.
Slot IDs must exist under that placeId’s slots.
Typos mean item cannot be equipped (UI may hide it, backend rejects equip).
Rule: Only use slotIds that exist in places.json for that place.
Images / assets
imageUrl
Purpose: What the UI loads as the card image (often /chemcard/xxx.jpeg).
Concern: Medium.
Must be a valid path accessible from hosting (usually public/chemcard/...).
Wrong path = broken image, but doesn’t usually break purchase.
imageKey, imageFile
Purpose: Internal asset bookkeeping (naming / migrations / uploads). Depending on your tooling, these may be used for storage migration scripts.
Concern: Medium. Safe if you’re consistent, risky if you have scripts that assume a convention.
spriteFile
Purpose: The sprite used when the item is equipped into the scene.
Concern: Medium-high for gameplay visuals: wrong sprite = invisible/wrong display.
Rarity / economy
rarity
Purpose: Item rarity tier used for UI styling, possibly drop rates (gacha), sorting.
Concern: Medium. Make sure it matches allowed values in your UI/backend expectations (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary).
Duplicate rarity column (you showed rarity  rarity)
Purpose: This is likely a CSV/header mistake (two columns with same name) or one is meant to be something else (e.g. rarityLabel vs rarity).
Concern: High because CSV parsing usually picks one and silently drops/overwrites the other.
Rule: You should keep only one rarity column in the published CSV.
rarityValue
Purpose: Numeric rarity score used for sorting or weighting.
Concern: Medium. Keep it numeric.
coinCost, diamondCost
Purpose: Store price. In Firestore these become shopData.coinCost / shopData.diamondCost (based on your seeder).
Used by: chemcityPurchaseCard.
Concern: High for economy/purchase.
Must be numeric.
If both blank/0, backend may treat it as “not purchasable”.
Extremely high values can block purchases or unbalance.
Progression / learning linkage
topicId
Purpose: Links the card to a topic (for curriculum/collection/reward systems).
Concern: Medium.
If topicId doesn’t exist, you might lose topic-based grouping/rewards (depends on your code).
What happens if you “manually change columns”?
Here are safe vs risky edits:

Safe edits (usually won’t break purchase/equip):
name, chemicalFormula, description, funFact, (sometimes) imageUrl
Risky edits (can break gameplay or cause “Item not found”):
id (highest risk)
placeId
validSlots
baseId
coinCost / diamondCost (can block purchase)
CSV-format risk:
Duplicate headers like rarity twice
